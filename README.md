Lightweight PHP MVC framework. This is barebones hackathon stuff (literally made at a hackathon). No BS, very customizable.

== Controller & Routing ==
You don't do any routing. It's automatic. You go to mywebsite.com/mysubdir it requests the Mysubdir class. First letter capitalized, nothing else capitalized.

Controllers should extend BaseController and must implement get() and post().

Create views with

<pre>
makeView('viewname');
</pre>

Pass view variables with

<pre>
makeView('viewname',array('var1'=>'val1','var2'=>'val2'));
</pre>

There's a createPartial function but really, you can just use makeView and maePartial interchangeably.
== Model ==
Just define a class and call it in controller.

== View == 
Views are just standard output php. 

== Issues ==
* Oh too many fringe cases for me to remember a single one
* Main functionality works so have fun!
